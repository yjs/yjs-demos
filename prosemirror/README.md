# ProseMirror Demo
> [y-prosemirror](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror) / [y-websocket](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket) / [Live Demo](https://demos.yjs.dev/prosemirror/prosemirror.html)

This is a demo of a [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) editor that was made collaborative with Yjs & y-prosemirror. This demo uses the [prosemirror-example-setup](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-example-setup) as a configuration. Learn more about how you can build your own custom editor with ProseMirror in [their documentation](https://github.com/yjs/y-prosemirror/).

We use the [y-websocket](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket) provider to share document updates through a server. There are many more providers available for Yjs - try switching to another provider. [See docs](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider).

Also you could try adding offline persistence to this demo. Wouldn't it be cool if document updates are persisted in the browser, so you can load your application load faster? Try it out: https://docs.yjs.dev/getting-started/allowing-offline-editing
