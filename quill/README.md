# Quill Demo
> [y-quill](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill) / [y-websocket](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket) / [Live Demo](https://demos.yjs.dev/quill/quill.html)

This is a demo of a [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) editor that was made collaborative with Yjs & y-quill. Learn more about how you can customize Quill in [their documentation](https://quilljs.com/).

We use the [y-websocket](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket) provider to share document updates through a server. There are many more providers available for Yjs - try switching to another provider. [See docs](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider).

Also you could try adding offline persistence to this demo. Wouldn't it be cool if document updates are persisted in the browser, so you can load your application faster? Try it out: https://docs.yjs.dev/getting-started/allowing-offline-editing
